# Libft
Libft - my first library

This is the first major project at 42 aimed to create essential functions, many of them are replicas of standard libraries, and many more are other very useful functions. Over the course of my education at 42, I have added more functions based on the needs of programs I have created.

Should you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to send me an email at **jwalsh@student.42.fr**.
